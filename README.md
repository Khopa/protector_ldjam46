### Description

This a 1-player Arcade action game.
You are a hero, with your antivirus gun, you must destroy the incoming viruses, survive and protect the nurse in an hospital.

### How to run

Download .nes ROM. Open it in your favorite NES emulator. 
I recommend to use [Mesen](https://mesen.ca/) for an optimal experience.

If you do not want to install an emulator, you can just go to https://jsnes.org/, then drag and drop the .nes rom on the webpage to play.
